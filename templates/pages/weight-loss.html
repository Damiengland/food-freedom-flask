            <h2>What is HCG?</h2>
            <p class="p-padding">
                The HCG Diet was designed by Dr Simeon in the 1950â€™s.<br/>
                Dr Simeon figured out that we have three different types of fat - structural fat, normal reserve fat and abnormal fat.
                He figured out a way for the body to move the abnormal fat and not the other essential types of fat.
                This is why weight loss is rapid and whilst you are only consuming 500 calories from food your body uses approximately 2,500 calories per day from your abnormal fat stores.

                    The HCG diet is designed to allow your body to use its own fat stores as fuel and to achieve rapid weight loss without hunger.
                    The program allows you to detox in a natural way and reset your metabolism.

            <h2>What is my role?</h2>
            <p class="p-padding">
                For many weight loss can be a simple as adding a bit more exercise and eating a bit less.
                But for many more of us it is a much more difficult equation that can cause a lifetime of anxiety and sadness.<br/>
                My job is to take the guess work out of the process, take control of the situation and ultimately help you reach your goals.
                My focus is to teach you the tools to achieve sustainable and permanent weight loss.
                These are a few key considerations that are incorporated in the program.
